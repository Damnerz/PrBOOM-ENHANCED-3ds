Uploader's email        : myk@fibertel.com.ar (add the word "doom" to the
                          subject if you message me, to avoid filters.)
Notes                   : These patches can be used either by Doom with a
                          GUS card or by any engines that support TiMidity
                          (like Boom, or those that use SDL.) The package
                          contains the full EAWPATS set plus the assorted
                          drum patches that Eric A. Welsh offered on his
                          site. Eric's site is gone, and while the patches
                          do show up on some Linux distros and sites, they
                          sometimes lack the extra drums or aren't easy to
                          locate or download.

Description             : This is a collection of Gravis UltraSound patches
                          for use with a GUS, or with "softsynth" midi
                          players such as Cubic Player and TiMidity.

* Construction *

Base                    : I collected patches from the Ultrasound mirrors,
                          Midia, Kurzweil archives, Roland archives, Yamaha
                          archives, Maui, maybe a few from MAZ, and just
                          about every known source of patches on the net.
May Not Run With...     : Engines that don't support either GUS cards or
                          TiMidity
